# Tim Ferriss-inspired (NOT endorsed) daily prompts

As a [Five Bullet Friday subscriber](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/), I've often been directed to Tim's Twitter/X
page, which in June 2024 posted a video with example questions in a bullet journal:

For the digitally-inclined, this plugin adds an [Amplenote Daily Jot Suggestion](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots_suggestions)
that will insert the provocative questions from the journal shown in the video:

1. I am grateful for... (3 responses)
2. What would make today great (3 responses)
3. Daily affirmation
4. Highlights of the day (3 responses)
5. What did I learn today?

Your responses to these questions will be tagged with a hierarchy of your choosing (e.g., `daily-jots/five-questions` or `personal/daily-data`). 

A table will also be created with links to all your daily entries, for convenient perusal.
